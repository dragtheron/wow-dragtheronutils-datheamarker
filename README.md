Dragtheron Utils: Dathea Marker
===============================

Key Features
------------

For the fight against Dathea the Ascended (T29 Raid, Vault of the Incarnates, Mythic), you will find five inactive NPC's
which are to be activated in a specific order.

This addon rotates through a predefined set of markers:

1. Star / Yellow
2. Circle / Orange
3. Square / Blue
4. Triangle / Green
5. Diamond / Purple

How to Use
----------

The markers will be set only on the NPS's from Dathea and **only while holding down Shift and Alt keys** when you click
that NPC to set that as your target.
